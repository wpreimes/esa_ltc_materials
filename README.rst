This package contains the jupyter notebooks for the "Soil Moisture" and "Drought" exercises held at the `ESA Land Training Course 2022 <https://landtraining2022.esa.int/>`_.

The package is designed to run on `mybinder.org <https://mybinder.org/>`_. To open a notebook in your browser click on one of the following badges. Please note that opening the files on mybinder may take a few minutes (`it takes longer if the notebook was not used for some time <https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about/user-guidelines.html#performance-and-speed>`_).

If you wish to run the notebooks locally, see the 'Local installation' section below

------------

**Exercise 1 - Satellite Soil Moisture** (click badge to launch)

 :target: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/pstradio/esa_ltc_materials/ltc_2023?labpath=lecture1_soil_moisture.ipynb

**Note**: *It can take a few minutes to open notebooks on mybinder. If jupyter-lab does not open in your browser after e.g. 5-10 minutes, refresh the mybinder loading page and try again.*

Jupyter notebook controls
-------------------------
If you are not familiar with Jupyter Notebooks, there are numerous tutorials available online, e.g. `here <https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/>`_ or `here <https://jupyter-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/first-steps/create-notebook.html>`_. Some cells in the notebooks depend on running previous cells first (otherwise you will see an error message). Therefore it is recommended to either run all cells directly (click ðŸž‚ðŸž‚) or running individual cells from top to bottom (â–º).

- **â–º** Run all code in a single block (cell)
- **â– ** Interrupt the kernel to stop any code execution
- **âŸ³** Restart the kernel
- **ðŸž‚ðŸž‚** Restart Kernel and run all cells

Other
-----
Data used in the tutorials is automatically downloaded when using binder (see the file ``postBuild``). However, if you want to download the data manually you can do this at https://cloud.geo.tuwien.ac.at/s/cNoJcXojZQyTfWG

At some point the materials might not be available anymore, in this case you can open an issue on github and we will send you the files.

Local installation
------------------
To run the notebooks locally, you need to clone the repository first (from the fork belonging to USER):

`git clone https://github.com/<USER>/esa_ltc_materials.git`

and move to the repository:

`cd path/to/esa_ltc_materials`

The datasets needed to run the notebooks are stored at the download link given in the `postBuild` script. Under linux you can just run it directly `./postBuild` which handles unzipping and creating the softlink for you. But you may also download and unzip the material manually, and copy (or softlink, with: `ln -s`) to the `esa_ltc_materials` local directory and rename it to `LTC_DATA`. The proper environment can be installed with 

`conda env create -f path/to/esa_ltc_materials/environment.yml -n esa_ltc` 

and activated: 

`conda activate esa_ltc`

After this, the notebooks can be run with the command: 

`jupyter lab`

Windows installation
--------------------
Download the repo with the installation and run scripts under this link:

https://owncloud.tuwien.ac.at/index.php/s/VunDPPGVaR8WKeM/download

Execute `install.bat` and then execute `run.bat`
